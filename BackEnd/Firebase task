After searching about way to use Firebase to receive an SMS with verification code when  trying to register as new user in the Food App , I found these :

1- Firebase doesn't have an SMS sending API  but wean use services like Nexmo or Twilio for that. Alternatively, you can use AWS SNS to send SMS.

2- we can send SMS Verification using Firebase and we cannot send ordinary SMS through Firebase.we can send using Twilio instead.
	Links : https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/phone-auth 
	and https://medium.com/nonstopio/otp-one-time-passcode-authentication-using-firebase-10b0111aba8a 
	we should add our project to Firebase and enable “Phone sign-in method” .
	this is the best way although phone numbers that end users provide for authentication will be sent and stored by Google .


	
3- I tried to understand Keycloak and how its  OTP work.
Keycloak authenticates users using:
   1-  Password
   2- An one-time password (OTP)
   
  * we can enforce user configure OTP , https://ultimatesecurity.pro/post/2fa/ 
  but this need User’s Mobile Authenticator   (FreeOTP OR Google Athenticator) that use to sacn a barcode to get generated code then user provide this code to complete login .
  but this method is used in web app not mobile app .
  
  * there is  a way that someone implemnted it . he implement keycloak authentication provider to get 2FA (2 FACTOR AUTH) with OTP then uses AWS SNS TO SEND SMS .

    Also we can use this way with twilio insted of AWS SNS .
